#Nagaram
CMS for local bodies in India

This is free and open source

Here's what I think it should include:
Git work flow
name of the projects and all sub-modules and libraries (sometimes they are named different and very confusing to new users)
descriptions of all the project, and all sub-modules and libraries
5-line code snippet on how its used (if it's a library)
copyright and licensing information (or "Read LICENSE")
instruction to grab the documentation
instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs
instruction to grab the latest code and detailed instructions to build it (or quick overview and "Read INSTALL")
list of authors or "Read AUTHORS"
instructions to submit bugs, feature requests, submit patches, join mailing list, get announcements, or join the user or dev community in other forms
other contact info (email address, website, company name, address, etc)
a brief history if it's a replacement or a fork of something else
legal notices (crypto stuff)
Apache HTTP Server has a simple yet good README. Another good one I found available online is GNU Make's README.

As per formatting, I would say stick to the Unix traditions as much as possible, and/or use markdown especially for github projects, which renders README.md as html.

ASCII characters only, if the README is written in English
write it in English if possible, and ship translated version with two-letter language code extension like README.ja
80 characters or less per line
single empty line between paragraphs
dashes under the headers
indent using whitespace (0x20) not tab
